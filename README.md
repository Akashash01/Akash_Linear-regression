 # **Real Estate Price Prediction Using Linear Regression Model**

In this project, I developed and implemented a machine learning model using linear regression to predict real estate property prices based on various features. The project aimed to provide accurate pricing forecasts by analyzing historical housing data and identifying key factors that influence property prices.

# Key Steps and Methodologies:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Gathered extensive real estate datasets, including property features such as location, size, number of rooms, year built, and amenities, as well as economic factors like interest rates and local market trends.
   - Conducted data cleaning processes, handling missing values, outliers, and normalizing data to ensure model robustness.
   - Performed feature engineering to create additional relevant predictors, such as proximity to public transport and neighborhood crime rates.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Utilized data visualization tools to gain insights into the distribution of prices and relationships between features and the target variable (price).
   - Identified key factors such as location, property size, and neighborhood quality as major determinants of price variation.

3. **Model Building**:
   - Implemented a linear regression algorithm, training the model on historical property data to establish relationships between features and property prices.
   - Conducted hyperparameter tuning, optimizing model performance and reducing errors in prediction.

4. **Model Evaluation and Validation**:
   - Split data into training and testing sets to validate the model’s accuracy and prevent overfitting.
   - Evaluated the model using performance metrics such as R-squared (R²) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to measure the accuracy of predictions.
   - Achieved a high R² score, indicating that the model was able to explain a significant portion of the variance in property prices.

5. **Results and Insights**:
   - The model provided highly accurate price predictions, allowing real estate agents and buyers to make data-driven decisions.
   - Key insights showed that properties located near business hubs and with modern amenities had the highest price growth.
   - The model identified that property age and economic factors like interest rates played a significant role in price fluctuations.


### **Tools and Technologies Used**:
   - **Languages/Frameworks**: Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy
   - **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
   - **Model Evaluation**: R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), cross-validation
